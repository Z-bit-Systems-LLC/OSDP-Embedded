# OSDP-Embedded — Phased Plan

This document captures the iteration roadmap. Architectural rules and the
locked decisions that constrain every iteration live in
[../CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md); this file focuses on **what gets built when**.

## Iteration 1 — Decoder

**Goal:** consume raw OSDP bytes (from captures or live serial) and produce
typed message structs. Foundation for both PD and ACU work later.

### Deliverables

1. **Repo skeleton** matching the layout in `CLAUDE.md`. Top-level `CMakeLists.txt`,
   `core/CMakeLists.txt`, `tests/CMakeLists.txt`. Builds clean on Windows
   (MSVC, clang, MinGW).
2. **Integrity primitives** in `core/src/shared/`:
   - `crc16.c` — OSDP CRC-16 per spec (verify polynomial, init, reflection
     against `docs/spec/SIA-OSDP-2.2-2.txt`).
   - `checksum.c` — 8-bit two's-complement checksum.
3. **Layer 1 framing** in `core/src/shared/frame.c`:
   - One-shot `osdp_frame_decode(buf, len, &frame)` returning header fields
     (SOM, address, length, control byte), payload slice, and integrity status.
   - Auto-detect CRC vs checksum from the control byte (CTRL bit 2).
   - Reject malformed frames with rich error info (error code + offset +
     offending bytes).
4. **Streaming decoder** in `core/src/shared/stream.c`:
   - `osdp_stream_init`, `osdp_stream_feed(byte)`, `osdp_stream_poll(&event)`.
   - Resync on garbage bytes; emit diagnostic events for bad-frame cases.
5. **Per-message codecs** for the v2.2 baseline set. Each TU contains model
   struct + decoder + builder, even though iteration 1 only exercises the
   decoder side. Builders are added in the same TU because the spec layout
   is symmetric and it avoids a churn-y refactor in iteration 2.
   - Commands: `osdp_POLL`, `osdp_ID`, `osdp_CAP`, `osdp_LED`, `osdp_BUZ`,
     `osdp_TEXT`, `osdp_OUT`, `osdp_COMSET`.
   - Replies: `osdp_ACK`, `osdp_NAK`, `osdp_PDID`, `osdp_PDCAP`, `osdp_RAW`,
     `osdp_KEYPAD`, `osdp_COM`.
6. **Dispatch helpers** in `core/src/dispatch/`:
   - `osdp_dispatch_command(&frame, &any_command)` and the reply equivalent.
   - Tagged-union output type. References every codec — opt-in only.
7. **Unity-based unit tests** under `tests/`:
   - CRC and checksum spec vectors.
   - Frame decode round-trip and negative cases (truncated, bad integrity,
     impossible length).
   - Stream resync behavior.
   - Per-message decode + re-build round-trip with byte-compare.
8. **README + CLAUDE + PLAN** docs (this set).
9. **OSDPCAP support** (added late in iteration 1):
   - `tools/osdp-parser/` — host-side CLI that reads OSDPCAP-format
     captures and prints decoded frames via the streaming decoder +
     dispatch classifier. Functions as the canonical Monitor consumer.
   - `tests/captures/` — drop-in directory for OSDPCAP files; CMake
     globs them at configure time and registers a CTest entry per
     capture, backed by `test_captures.c`.
   - `test_osdpcap.c` — unit tests for the OSDPCAP reader itself.

### Out of scope for Iteration 1

- Rust crates (directories may be scaffolded, but no code yet).
- PD, ACU, or Monitor application code (state machines, transports).
- Secure Channel.

### Definition of done

- All Unity tests pass on Windows host (MSVC + clang + MinGW).
- Decoder correctly round-trips every captured sample we have, including
  any traffic logs the user provides.
- A consumer can write `target_link_libraries(myapp PRIVATE osdp::core osdp::messages)`
  and successfully decode a baseline OSDP frame in fewer than 20 lines of
  code.

## Iteration 2 — Encoder TX paths and applications (planned)

- Promote the per-message builders from "incidentally compiled" to
  first-class with their own test suite.
- Introduce `pd/`, `acu/`, `monitor/` peer trees with role-specific state
  machines and transport HALs.
- First end-to-end PD example on host (loopback) and on a target MCU
  (TBD — likely STM32 or Nordic).
- Extend `osdp-parser` (or add a sibling tool) to drive synthetic
  capture playback for testing PD/ACU state machines.

## Iteration 3 — Secure Channel (planned)

- AES-128-CBC session, SCBK / SCBK-D handling, MAC, secure pairing.
- Crypto behind a HAL: software fallback (mbedTLS) on host; hardware AES
  on MCU targets.
- Touches framing (SCB block in control byte), every command/reply path,
  and PD/ACU state machines. Plan a clean migration of existing per-message
  TUs rather than a fork.

## Iteration 4+ — Optional extensions (not yet planned)

- File transfer, biometric, keypad extensions, manufacturer-specific
  commands, multi-part messages, certifiable test harness.
- Rust wrapper crate hardening + publishing.
